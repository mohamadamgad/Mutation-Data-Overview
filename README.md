# Mutation-Data-Overview

This task is a browser-based JavaScript tool using d3.js visualization library for interactive visualization of mutations in cancer. When the main page load it displays 2 figures. The first one is a histogram that shows the mutaition and the frequency of its occurence. The second one is a pie chart that displays the chromosome number. 
When the user clicks on any chromosome in the pie chart, the corresponding mutations are highlighted in  the histogram.

To run the project just open the index.html file in the browser.
